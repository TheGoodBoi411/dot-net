        Notice how I didn't say "Skills" yet.
    This is because I am very new to everything here, so I wouldn't consider anything past something I enjoy.

    <h1>JS TS BS</h1>
    <p>
        I got into JavaScript through Beat Saber modcharting.
        The map files are <span class="font-monospace">.json</span>, so this makes sense.
        Then the tool <a href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper">ReMapper</a> was released and it changed everything about how maps were made.
        It uses TypeScript, so I switched after a bit of relearning.
        I'm trying to use TS as my main language now as it seems okay for many other uses.

    <h1>Websites to Shaders</h1>
    <p>
        While HTML and HLSL are similar in name, they are very differnt.
        I tried HTML because I thought JS is used a lot in it.
        Turns most of websites isn't about coding, but the formatting, oh well!
        As for shaders, they look cool.
