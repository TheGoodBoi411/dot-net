# Website

Give a man a fish, he eats for a day.
Give a man a playlist of HTML tutorials,  he- huh?

## Idea

A while ago I saw a YouTube Short about having your own website.
I kept it in my mind, until I saw a [video](https://youtu.be/BZqzhmlTkAc) about someone's favorite personal websites.
These unique websites - mostly the first one - inspired me to make my own.
I started by making a landing page and the Beat Saber graphic you can see [here](../../beat-saber).
Then I gave up.
Turns out making a very nice website as your first is not easy.
So, I moved on.

But, as I was randomly looking at Discord profiles I saw https://kivalevan.me.
Someone who also plays Beat Saber has a cool little website that isn't too complex?
I convinced myself that I should make one.

So I started with [Astro](https://astro.build) (idea taken from Kival) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), ready for something much better.
I made a simple(r) landing page, and kept expanding until I was happy!
