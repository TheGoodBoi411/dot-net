Y’know, I don’t *just* like Beat Saber, I have many interests! I also have a school to attend to and a bed to sleep in, which takes up most of my time in this life. Sometimes I feel like it’s hard to juggle all of this while keeping a flow of content that some may expect from me.

Though recently, I’ve tried ignoring some of this pressure. Most of the stuff I make is for Beat Saber, so whenever I do other things and play other games I feel like I’m letting people down. Posting only my new maps every so often, and seldom talking in Discord. But, after uploading [Death by Beast](https://youtu.be/Tu_kV84mwDE), I might try doing other things more often and publicly sharing them! Taking a break from Beat Saber for a bit to indulge in other stuff I find interesting is quite fun, and can even give me new ideas when coming back.

# So,

If you ever see me stop or slow down on uploading, I’m probably active somewhere else. Here’s a few things that this has happened with:
- YTPMV's
- [Universe of Free to Edit](https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Universe_of_Free_To_Edit) - I made [this](https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_of_Exclaimed_Warning)
- [Zachtronics’ games](https://www.zachtronics.com)
- Baba is You
- Minecraft (really got me)

My YouTube Channel was originally for any game I decided to play at the time, but transitioned to pure Beat Saber content after I got the game. After feeling locked into that for a while in fear of people unsubscribing, I now realize that I don’t care.

Stay tuned for whatever comes next!
