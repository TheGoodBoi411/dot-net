# A Long Time Ago

I played Wii Sports for the first time when I was around 4-5 years old.
I was terrible, I always played with family so I never understood the skill system, and the game was (and still is) older than I am.
But, it was very fun.
My best sport was bowling, as I somehow managed to get to a level of 1000 skill.
This granted me the ⦗PR✪⦘ tag along with a stary new ball.
I actually got and played a bunch of games on the Wii, it was pretty awesome.
Of course, I eventually stopped playing for one reason or another.

# That Wii U Thing They Made

Many years later, I got a Wii U, mostly for playing Mario Maker.
Interestingly, the Wii U has a Wii emulator inside of it, meaning we could get rid of our Wii and start playing games on there.
My family and I actually played the Wii a lot, Wii Party was - and still might be - our favorite to play together.

Soon enough, I remembered Wii Sports, and after seeing YouTubers such as [Poofesure](https://www.youtube.com/@Poofesure) and [Nicro](https://www.youtube.com/@nicroveda) go for perfect games of bowling, I wanted to go back and try it for myself.
I found a tutorial on how to get a strike every time, and on my second attempt, got the perfect game.
It was super rewarding, but after that, I didn't really know what else to do with Wii Sports.
However, Nicro played on Wii Sports *Resort*, which I did not have.
Obviously, I had to buy it, and check out the new sports it had.

# Resort

Welp, I mainly played bowling.
I played every sport at least once, but I still had some flashing "NEW" tags on the menu.
During this time I understood the skill level system a bit better, and tried getting to the maximum level for bowling.
I was able to get perfect games quite consistently, even getting three in a row at one point.
Unfortunately though, I got bored before reaching the highest possible level.
Soon enough, I stoped playing.

# Today

I recently played Wii Sports Resort again, trying out some new sports I didn't focus on last time.
At this point, I believe I fully understand the skill system and stamps, and I've attempted going for a few.
I was able to beat Matt in a swordplay duel, play against the island's table tennis teacher, and wakeboard better than before.
I then decided to mod the game, installing the [Storm Island](https://gamebanana.com/mods/322739) modpack and playing around with it.
I was also able to figure out some basic text, music, and image replacement, so that I was able to add some funny quirks of my own.

As of now, I've stopped playing WSR, but I don't think I'll ever get truly tired of it.
